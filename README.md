If this repository occurs to you, it is truely my pleasure. And, I hope any of this code could make a help for you.
At fact, this repository is a collection of my study on python, especially based on Arcpy(ArcGIS 9.3.x ~ 10.x). Every single .py file or folder can work independently. 
Next, I will try my best to make a clear instrument for each function.

1. MultiValue2Zones
   This script will statistic the value of given rasters within the
zones of another polygon shapefile and report the results to a
CSV file.
This script can calculate values included "MEAN","MAJORITY",
"MAXIMUM","MEDIAN","MINIMUM","MINORITY","RANGE","STD","SUM",
"VARIETY". Each raster's value will be appended to the origin
shapefile's attribute table and named by the corresponding
raster's name.

2. AddNearAtrributesDirections
